# FAQ

## Do I need to read the full PDF first?

No.

Start with:

- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
- `START_HERE.md`
- `GLOSSARY.md`

Then use `occ list` and `occ run` to explore the suite.

## What does NO-EVAL mean?

It means the claim is not yet operationally defined (\\(\Omega_I\\)) or depends on inaccessible knobs.

## Why is there an extensions suite?

To improve UX and tooling (meta-MRDs) without changing the canonical 15-module suite.
