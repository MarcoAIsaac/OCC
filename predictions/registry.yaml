    title: "EDM ↔ GW correlation in baryogenesis"
    status: featured
    summary: >-
      OCC canon highlights an explicit, falsifiable correlation between an electric
      dipole moment (EDM) signal channel and a gravitational-wave (GW) signature in
      baryogenesis scenarios.
    domain: "Cosmology / Baryogenesis"
    observables:
      - "EDM (electric dipole moment) constraints / measurements"
      - "Stochastic GW background features"
    tests:
      - "Cross-check EDM bounds vs GW parameter inference"
      - "Search for correlated signatures across channels"
    timeframe: "Mid-term (depends on experimental / observational programs)"

    title: "Capture-yield / delayed-neutron consistency window in isotope-resolved campaigns"
    status: draft
    summary: >-
      In isotope-resolved neutron campaigns, OCC predicts a falsifiable consistency
      window linking prompt capture-yield channels with delayed-neutron fractions
      across the same declared energy range and reaction channel.
    domain: "Nuclear Physics / Reactor-relevant neutron interactions"
    observables:
      - "Prompt gamma capture yield as a function of neutron energy"
      - "Delayed-neutron fraction by isotope and energy bin"
    tests:
      - "Joint fit consistency over shared energy_range_mev and isotope set"
      - "Cross-lab replication with identical reaction_channel declarations"
    timeframe: "Near-term (existing neutron beamline and spectroscopy programs)"
