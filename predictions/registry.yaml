    title: "EDM ↔ GW correlation in baryogenesis"
    status: featured
    summary: >-
      OCC canon highlights an explicit, falsifiable correlation between an electric
      dipole moment (EDM) signal channel and a gravitational-wave (GW) signature in
      baryogenesis scenarios.
    domain: "Cosmology / Baryogenesis"
    observables:
      - "EDM (electric dipole moment) constraints / measurements"
      - "Stochastic GW background features"
    tests:
      - "Cross-check EDM bounds vs GW parameter inference"
      - "Search for correlated signatures across channels"
    timeframe: "Mid-term (depends on experimental / observational programs)"
